# PUMPFOLD 🚀🔬

**PUMPFOLD** is the very first self-hosted bioengineering AI-agent powered by **DeepSeek** and **AlphaFold**! 🤖💡 It autonomously explores protein characteristics and generates innovative academic research topics. Perfect for pushing the boundaries of AIGC in bioengineering! 🔍🧬

---

## Overview 🌟

PUMPFOLD leverages the AUTOGPT framework along with DeepSeek to:
- 🔬 **Select Target Proteins:** Retrieve sequences & preliminary annotations from databases (e.g., UniProt, PDB) 📚.
- 🧩 **Autonomously Research:** Automatically gather cutting-edge literature from platforms like bioRxiv 🔍📑.
- 🧠 **Generate Research Proposals:** Fuse 3D structural data (via AlphaFold) with literature insights to propose innovative, unexplored topics! 💥📝
- ⚙️ **Design Experiments:** Propose experimental designs (mutagenesis, structural validation, etc.) to verify hypotheses in a closed-loop manner 🔄.

## Roadmap 🗺️✨

### Phase 1: Basic Version 🛠️
- **Target Protein Selection**  
  • Use public databases to pick important or under-explored proteins 📖🔎.
- **Autonomous Data Gathering**  
  • Employ the AUTOGPT framework with DeepSeek to automatically retrieve and summarize relevant papers (e.g., from bioRxiv) 📑🤖.
  • Fetch 3D structure data and key interaction points via AlphaFold’s API 🏗️.
- **Multi-Dimensional Research Proposals**  
  • Integrate structural and literature data to map out initial research directions (e.g., conformational dynamics, enzyme kinetics, PPIs) 🔄💡.
- **Preliminary Topic Generation**  
  • Cache and layer the gathered data to build a research roadmap 🗂️📊.
  • Automatically propose initial research topics with theoretical hypotheses and experimental design suggestions 📝🚀.

---

### Phase 2: Local Computation Upgrade 💻⚡
- **Local DeepSeek Deployment**  
  • Deploy DS R1 locally via Docker/Kubernetes for faster and private computation 🐳🔐.
  • Optimize and store model parameters locally for robust handling of diverse protein data 📈.
- **Information Pre-Extraction Module**  
  • Introduce a lightweight model to summarize research findings, reducing token usage ⬇️📝.
- **Closed-Loop Experimental Design**  
  • Automatically construct a topic validation network linking research proposals and experimental designs 🔗🧪.
  • Incorporate experimental feedback to refine and iterate research topics in a feedback loop 🔄📉.

---

### Phase 3: Multi-Model Adversarial System ⚔️🤖
- **Adversarial Proposal Model**  
  • Develop adversarial models based on DS R1 to critically evaluate and refine research topics 🔍🛡️.
- **Interactive Model Collaboration**  
  • Establish interaction between the main and adversarial models to fuse and optimize final research outputs 🤝💡.
  • Integrate an automatic “peer review” module simulating expert feedback for continuous model improvement 🧐✍️.
- **Performance Evaluation & Continuous Improvement**  
  • Define multi-dimensional evaluation metrics (innovation, feasibility, data consistency) 📊⭐.
  • Collect expert feedback and retrain the adversarial models iteratively for sustained performance enhancement 🔄🚀.
